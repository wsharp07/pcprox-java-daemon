# PcProx Java Daemon
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wsharp07/pcprox-java-daemon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wsharp07/pcprox-java-daemon)

A Java daemon application for interacting with pcProx card readers and recording card reads. Tested and built on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.

### Prerequisites

1. See the README file in the `lib` folder for the files you will need to copy there from the pcProx SDK. More information on the SDK can be found here: https://www.rfideas.com/products/sdk/universal-enroll-sdk
2. Requires MongoDB to record card data information. https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16.04/

### Building the app

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Installing the app

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/pcprox-javad/lib
sudo cp build/output/lib/* /usr/local/pcprox-javad/lib
sudo cp log4j2.xml /usr/local/pcprox-javad
```

### Running the daemon

```bash
sudo ./pcprox-javad.sh start
```

### Side notes

* You have to use `LD_PRELOAD` when running the app. I believe this to be due to a linker issue during compliation of the pcProxAPI

* You must run as root in order to connect to the reader

* Because of the complication of the pcProxAPI I had to wrap the system calls, as they needed to be referenced by symbol
